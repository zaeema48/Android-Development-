    <string name="textview">This Vegetarian Burrito Recipe is full of the flavors of Mexico. If you are in need of a portable, handheld meal, look no further than the humble burrito for inspiration. A simple tortilla (or roti) is stuffed with homemade refried beans, fajita style veggies like bell peppers and mushrooms, creamy guacamole, fresh pico de gallo and sour cream. YUM! This family favorite recipe for from-scratch vegetarian burritos is full of flavor, and better yet, quite easy to make. The savory spiced bell pepper and mushroom stuffing comes together in under 30 minutes, while the pico de gallo salsa and guacamole are a breeze to makeI personally make homemade refried beans a day ahead of our vegetarian burrito feasts, but you can just as easily opt for canned refried beans or swap in rice if you prefer. If you don’t have easy access to sour cream, you can also make your own by stirring a teaspoon of lemon juice into ½ cup of heavy whipping cream.Assembling a burrito is very easy once you have the stuffings prepared. I show you how to wrap them up in the step-wise photos below. To make these burrito recipe, opt for whole wheat tortillas for a bit of extra nutrition, but regular flour tortillas, corn tortillas, whole wheat roti or even flavored roti will all work as well.</string>
